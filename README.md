#### March 18, 2016

#### By Chris Young

## Description

A simple Node.js web application template.

## Set-Up Instructions

To run the app locally, you will need to download the project from my github repository.

#### NPM/Bower Install
Once the project has been cloned onto your local machine, you will need to install the Node & Bower dependencies. On the command line, navigate to the root of the project directory and run the following commands:
* npm install
* bower install

#### Run the Local Server
On the command line, at the root of the project directory, run the following commands:
* gulp build
* gulp serve

This will concatenate and compile the necessary JavaScript files and then run the local server. It should automatically open the page (located at http://localhost:3000/) in your preferred browser.

## Technologies Used

JavaScript, Node.js, Bower, Gulp, Sass CSS
